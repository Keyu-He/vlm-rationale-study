The reasoning behind this answer is that a suitcase is a piece of luggage typically used for traveling, whereas a backpack, purse, or briefcase are bags used for carrying personal belongings or work-related items. The presence of a doll in the suitcase further supports the idea that it is a piece of luggage, as dolls are not typically carried in a backpack, purse, or briefcase.",
