    "prediction_is_correct": 0,
    "generated_rationale": "The fruit that can hurt your eyes if you peel it holding your face too close to it is the banana. This is because the peel of a banana contains a chemical called tropane alkaloid, which can cause irritation and discomfort when it comes into contact with the eyes. The other fruits, such as pear, orange, and mango, do not contain this chemical and are not likely to cause any harm when peeled and held close to the eyes.",

This can be inferred from the fact that he is sitting on the floor and working on a piece of fabric, which is likely to be the kite's sail. Kites are typically made from lightweight materials such as paper, fabric, or plastic, and they are designed to catch the wind and stay airborne. The process of making a kite typically involves cutting the sail to the desired shape, attaching the sail to a frame or spine, and adding a tail to stabilize the kite in the air. In this case, the man is in the process of assembling the kite, which is why he is sitting on the floor and working on the fabric.",

Domestic pets are typically cared for by their owners and are more likely to be well-groomed and well-behaved compared to other types of dogs. Additionally, the fact that the dog is posing for the camera indicates that it is accustomed to human interaction, further supporting the idea that it is a domestic pet rather than a farm dog, service dog, or stray dog.",

This is because they are the furthest away from the body of water, which provides a natural source of warmth. In contrast, the person on the left side of the bench is closer to the water, and the person on the right side is also relatively close to the water. Therefore, the person in the middle of the bench would be the coldest due to their distance from the water source.",
