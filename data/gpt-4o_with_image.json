However, sauces can sometimes contain added sugars or sodium.\n\n3. **Cheese**: While cheese is a good source of calcium and protein, it also contains saturated fats and should be consumed in moderation for a balanced diet.\n\n4. **Mushroom**: Mushrooms are low in calories and rich in nutrients such as B vitamins, selenium, and antioxidants. They are also a good source of fiber and protein for their calorie count.\n\nConsidering these factors, mushrooms stand out as they provide a range of nutrients with fewer downsides compared to the other options.\n\nThus, the answer is \"mushroom.\"",
