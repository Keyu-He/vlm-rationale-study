        "generated_rationale": "The reasoning behind the answer \"sale\" is that the presence of a bow on the car is often associated with promotions, discounts, or special offers. In this context, the bow serves as a visual cue to attract potential buyers and entice them to purchase the car at a reduced price. It is a common practice in the automotive industry to use eye-catching elements, such as a bow, to create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to make a purchase decision.",

        "predicted_answer": "Generate electricity",
        "prediction_is_correct": 0,
        "generated_rationale": "The large wheel on the left is a wind turbine. Wind turbines are devices that convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy. They work by using the force of the wind to turn the blades of the turbine, which are connected to a generator. The generator then produces electricity, which can be used to power homes, businesses, and other facilities. The reasoning behind my answer is that wind turbines are commonly used to generate electricity, and the large wheel in the image is most likely a wind turbine.",
