    "generated_rationale": "The reasoning behind my answer is that the woman is sitting inside an open refrigerator, which is an unconventional and unusual place to sit. The other options, such as an office, a freezer, or a house, would not provide the same level of enclosure and comfort as a refrigerator. The refrigerator's door being open allows the woman to comfortably sit inside, making it the most plausible choice for the situation depicted in the image.",

    "prediction_is_correct": 0,
    "generated_rationale": "Meter enforcement has their days off on weekdays. This is because parking meters are typically enforced during weekdays when there is a higher demand for parking spaces in urban areas. On weekends and holidays, the demand for parking spaces is generally lower, which allows for more relaxed enforcement of parking regulations. The reasoning behind this schedule is to ensure that parking spaces are available for people who need them during the week while still allowing for some flexibility on weekends and holidays.",
