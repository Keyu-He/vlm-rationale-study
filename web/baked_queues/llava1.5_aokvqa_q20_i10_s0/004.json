    "generated_rationale": "The zebra's stripes serve as a form of thermoregulation. The black and white stripes create an optical illusion known as \"motion dazzle,\" which makes it difficult for predators to single out an individual zebra when they are in a group. This helps protect the zebra from attacks by predators such as lions and hyenas. The stripes also help in regulating the zebra's body temperature, as the black stripes absorb more sunlight and heat than the white stripes, creating small-scale air currents that help dissipate heat from the zebra's body.",
