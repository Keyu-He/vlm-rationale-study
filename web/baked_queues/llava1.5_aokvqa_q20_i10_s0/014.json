This could be due to their skill level, experience, or simply because they are enjoying the thrill of skiing at a faster speed. It is important to note that skiing at a faster pace can increase the risk of accidents and injuries, so it is crucial for skiers to maintain control and be aware of their surroundings while skiing at high speeds.",
