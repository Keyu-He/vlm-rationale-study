This is because the peel of a banana contains a chemical called tropane alkaloid, which can cause irritation and discomfort when it comes into contact with the eyes. The other fruits, such as pear, orange, and mango, do not contain this chemical and are not likely to cause any harm when peeled and held close to the eyes.",

The process of making a kite typically involves cutting the sail to the desired shape, attaching the sail to a frame or spine, and adding a tail to stabilize the kite in the air.
