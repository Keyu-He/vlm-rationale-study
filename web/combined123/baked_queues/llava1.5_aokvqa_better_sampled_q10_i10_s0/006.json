Chefs often wear white jackets as part of their uniform, which helps to maintain cleanliness and professionalism in the kitchen.

A knife is a versatile and efficient tool for slicing, dicing, and chopping various types of vegetables, such as carrots and green beans. It allows for precise control over the size and shape of the cuts, making it easier to prepare the vegetables for cooking or serving.
